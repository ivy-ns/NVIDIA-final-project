# NVIDIA-final-project: Personalized Skincare Routine Based On Your Skin type

Currently, there are many trends surrounding skincare, resulting in the purchase of unnecessary products that could do more harm than good for their skin. So, in order to solve this issue, I want to educate more people on their skin type so that they can purchase skincare that will be useful for them. I applied AI and machine learning with NVIDIA to train my Jetson Nano to recognize three major skin types; oily, normal and dry, and also added a recommendations for a morning and night skincare routine. 

# Algorithm
- train imagenet model
- install pytorch
- upload dataset into Google Drive and link the Drive to Colab (where I trained my nano)
- train the nano, accuracy of the output can depend on dataset and amount of Epochs
- export model into vs code 

# Running this project
- find dataset
- train Jetson Nano with your dataset of choice (I did it on Colab) 
- run in vs code by importing a picture of a face/skin into vs code and then use the python3 command to run
